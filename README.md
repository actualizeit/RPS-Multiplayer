# Now you can play rock paper scissors while having a flame war. You're welcome.

Dude I really don't wanna take out the trash. Let's play for it.

## Getting Started

Click one of the buttons to pick rock, paper or scissors. Once another player joins and makes a selection it will determine who won and keep track of wins losses and ties.

Get inside your opponent's head with some sweet smack talk. It's the only way to play my friend.

### Prerequisites

This game requires an internet connection and browser such as Chrome, Firefox or IE I guess if you're into that kinda thing.

### Installing

No installation necessary, this thing runs in the browser!

## Running the tests

Click a bunch of stuff and see what happens. Then tell me if you want.
